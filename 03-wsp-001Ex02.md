The main purpose of Typescript is to safeguard the type, allowing clear usage of variables and function 


For Question number 1 
1. This findFactors function
   ```
    change findFactors(num) to findFactors(num:any) 
    to address ts-7006 error

    to address ts-7005 error 
   ```

2. The following LeapYear function
